"""My daughter has been on epiduo since 8th grade (12) and she is still on it now in junior year (16) and it really does work wonders. Her skin is completely pimple free with the occasional 1 or 2 pimples here and there. This product really does work. The only problem is the occasional burning, flaking, and dry sensation. They started about one year after taking the product, although it does vary depending on your skin type. For all the people suffering from this, I suggest first completely washing your face then applying a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil. After, apply a very thing layer of Vaseline on your face (trust me, it works) then apply the Epiduo with a pea-sized amount.

"""I had my first zit before I even entered my teens. My dad has &quot;problem&quot; skin and blessed me with the same. It was not unusual to see me constantly wiping the excess oil from my face and sporting a huge zit or two. As a young adult, I&#039;ve tried a ton of those over-the-counter products like Noxema, Clearasil, Proactiv, Neutrogena, etc. But I found that as I got older my acne just got worse. So, I began seeing a dermatologist and we tried several things: doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, epiduo, differin, tretinoin, clindamycin and birth control pills (for the benefit of clearer skin). And I must admit that some of these regimen helped but the minute the doctor felt that it cleared up enough and stopped the medication, my skin would worsen. So, with my oily skin and now experiencing breakouts more frequently and especially around my mouth and jaw area, I had had enough and decided to try Accutane. 
Medication: I was prescribed MYORISAN 40mg for 6 months.
Experience: In the first month, the breakout could be described as the worse I have ever had. I had developed larger, more painful and a lot more acne than at any time that I could remember. I was so discouraged but had to keep believing in my dermatologist&#039;s promise of clear skin. After the first month, the breakout lessened and my skin began to dry out. Now I was required to moisturize my skin which was something that I would have not have dared to do prior to treatment. My lips began to chap and crack but that was easily remedied with chapstick or any other type of lip gloss. My skin was a lot more sensitive than before. I used to be able to wash my face with warm water and a wash cloth, but now the skin was so thin/dry that it would actually damage the skin and develop a scab the next day. I had to wear sunblock and a hat when I exercised in the park. If I didn&#039;t wear enough, I would suffer a mild sun burn. I didn&#039;t suffer any nose bleeds or depression. As the months went on I became acne free. And I was even told by someone that I had beautiful skin. Can you imagine my surprise?! I was in heaven.
My dermatologist recommended that I apply Epiduo and tretinoin to my skin every two days after I took my last Accutane pill. This surprised me because I thought my days of acne medication were over. After I took my last pill, my skin remained clear and dry of excessive oil for a couple of months but gradually I began to develop a few small zits and my skin was becoming oily again. This was not the promise that my dermatologist gave me. He said I&#039;d be acne free and at the very most I would be a small bump around the time of my menstruation. I can without a doubt tell you that is not my reality. 
It has now been almost 6 months since I completed my Accutane treatment and I am once again carrying around napkins to wipe the excessive oil from my face throughout the day. And there are days when I have several zits on my face at any given time. I don&#039;t dare moisturize my already oily skin. But honestly speaking, my breakouts are not to the degree of what they used to be prior to Accutane because the pimples are smaller. But I&#039;m unsure that if it&#039;s too early to tell and that maybe with more time it may all go back to how it was originally. I guess time will tell.""",8,0.1254,0.4912,617.0,0.05997,0.00324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,zit entered teens dad quot;problem&quot skin blessed unusual constantly wiping excess oil face sporting huge zit young adult i&#039;ve tried ton counter products like noxema clearasil proactiv neutrogena etc found got older acne got worse began seeing dermatologist tried things doxycycline minocycline tetracycline epiduo differin tretinoin clindamycin birth control pills benefit clearer skin admit regimen helped minute doctor felt cleared stopped medication skin worsen oily skin experiencing breakouts frequently especially mouth jaw area decided try accutane medication prescribed myorisan mg months experience month breakout described worse developed larger painful lot acne time remember discouraged believing dermatologist&#039;s promise clear skin month breakout lessened skin began dry required moisturize skin dared prior treatment lips began chap crack easily remedied chapstick type lip gloss skin lot sensitive able wash face warm water wash cloth skin thin dry actually damage skin develop scab day wear sunblock hat exercised park didn&#039;t wear suffer mild sun burn didn&#039;t suffer nose bleeds depression months went acne free told beautiful skin imagine surprise heaven dermatologist recommended apply epiduo tretinoin skin days took accutane pill surprised thought days acne medication took pill skin remained clear dry excessive oil couple months gradually began develop small zits skin oily promise dermatologist gave said i&#039;d acne free small bump time menstruation doubt tell reality months completed accutane treatment carrying napkins wipe excessive oil face day days zits face given time don&#039;t dare moisturize oily skin honestly speaking breakouts degree prior accutane pimples smaller i&#039;m unsure it&#039;s early tell maybe time originally guess time tell

I find though that the first pills really curbed my appetite.  Now a few pills later it doesn&#039;t seem to be as strong as the beginning. Will continue on them for one month and see how it goes.

Main problem is that it wears off in a few hours so you need to dose multiple times a day.  It causes you to sweat a little more and be a little more irritable than usual but it is really a great med to help depression.  It is much different and better than Wellbutrin for sure even though both are NDRI&#039;s.  Check out the research on stimulants for depression and bipolar depression.

"""I have been dealing with general and situational anxiety disorder and panic attacks on and off since college.  Tried Paxil and Prozac. Paxil made me gain 20 lbs. and Prozac increased my anxiety.  Lexapro works.

My advice: Try taking Lexapro for at least one week. The first week you will feel tired, dizzy, and mildly nauseated. Those effects disappear very quickly.  Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks.

"""I have spent a lot of time reading threads on Prozac. They have all been very helpful during these past few months so I thought I should share my own experiences just in case anyone out there might find it helpful.  I started Prozac 20mg about 2 months ago.  I always knew I had anxiety and mild depression and was always curious about taking anti-depressants. But when my boyfriend and I broke up I literally went to my PsycDoc the very next day. I had done my research on AD&rsquo;s and thought that Prozac would be the best for me. My Doc agreed. I kept a log every single day I took Prozac starting from Day #1 until Day #30.  It took 24 days before I started feeling little random bursts of happiness. But up until day #24 it was pure torture. It hurt to smile, I completely lost my appetite, I could not sleep, I was sad, I experienced soooo much anxiety is was painful. But thanks to reading all these threads I did not give up and was hopeful that things will get better just as everyone said it will. Every day after Day #24 just seemed to have gotten better and better. And on Day #30, it finally hit me and I understood what Prozac is all about. Yes it is true that it is a life saver. If I had to put it in just two words to explain how I feel on Prozac I would have to say &ldquo;Calm&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clear&rdquo;. But I&rsquo;m not finished just yet&hellip; after a few weeks I started feeling like the 20mg wasn&rsquo;t really working. So my Doc increased my dose to 40mg. this time around I almost gave up and went back to 20mg, but thankfully I did not. For 3 weeks of taking 40mg I was soooo tired, fatigue and lethargic. I did not experience this on 20mg. and I was constantly hungry too. So after week #3 I called my Doc so I can make an appointment to go back down to 20mg. he was out of town so I had to wait. When his office called me back to schedule me in, the awful side effects of 40mg were gone and I was back to feeling clear, calm and happy again. So here is my own personal advice from my own journey with Prozac&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been on it for a little over 2 months. You have to get worse before you get better. No matter what you think, YOU WILL GET BETTER. Prozac is literally reprogramming and rewiring your brain and that TAKES TIME.

I&#039;ve had no nausea or diarrhea with Trulicity.  Only mild headache, decreased appetite, some abdominal soreness/achiness, and low blood sugars during the day.  Now,  I take 5-10 units of Novolog prior to meals and at times none at all depending on my blood sugar reading.  My Levemir has decreased as well-  I take 42 units at night vs the previous dosage of 50 units twice daily.  My weight is down 6 lbs.  I recently filled a prescription for a 90-day supply of Trulicity and did not have a co-pay.  Overall,  I am pleased.""",9,0.02542,0.4563,134.0,0.04477,0.03732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,addendum june post a1c that&#039;s points months yaay endo pleased started trulicity having gi issues janumet i&#039;ve nausea diarrhea trulicity mild headache decreased appetite abdominal soreness achiness low blood sugars day units novolog prior meals times depending blood sugar reading levemir decreased well- units night vs previous dosage units twice daily weight lbs recently filled prescription day supply trulicity co pay overall pleased

I took Clindamycin every 6 hours, so in between (that is, 3 hours after the antibiotic) I would take an Acidophlius capsule. I didn&#039;t bother getting up in the night to do this.

I am a regular guy, regular build, height, size. Aged 61 and a Leo (not that this makes a difference). 
When I say I&#039;m a regular guy I mean that in the last 60 odd years I have been as regular as clockwork in the BM (Bowel Movement) department That was until last Saturday morning.
WARNING GRAPHIC DETAILS FOLLOW: (Written in laymen&#039;s terms)
Day 1:  Saturday
I awoke went to the loo, nothing happened!   I sat there needing a wee and if you are like me during or shortly after I wee I poo.  Not today!
Got up off the loo and went about my day. Several times though the day I went and sat on the loo and tried to pee, with just a trickle for my efforts. I felt that I really needed a poo. 
As the day went on I felt almost as if each bum cheek was solid, I mean rock hard. (That&#039;s not good)I was thinking to myself. Still unable to poo and pushing on each bum cheek to try and move stuff about a bit in the hope that I might be able to squeeze a bit out. NOPE! Went to bed.
Day 2: Sunday
I awoke in the morning really really needing a wee and a poo.  Still rock hard bum cheeks but now liquid poo was dripping/running out of my bum.  This persisted throughout the day every time I sat on the loo.  I spent four hours sitting there trying desperately to go the pain was so bad I was literally screaming in pain. The pain was situated mostly around my perineum.  
I would describe pain as having an elephant standing with its back legs on your dick and its front legs bouncing on your bladder OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOuch! This continued all day.
I tried two table spoons of olive oil mixed with fresh lemon juice and Loads of water. NOTHING!
Day 3: Monday 
Woke up went the loo worked on massaging each bum cheek had a small motion when I say small I mean the size of a pea. I was however able to pea (opps I mean pee) still rock hard impacted bum dripping with runny poo. 
I worked on each bum cheek rubbing and massaging as I sat on the loo for what seemed like most of the day gradually I was able to work most of it out as it became slightly softer.
Day 4: Tuesday
Woke up still unable to poo but weeing with ease when I needed to Bum cheeks felt normal (bit saggy as I&#039;m getting older, I used to be such a fit tasty kind of guy with a great arse).  Today I am getting worried as I have never had anything like this happen to me I have always been fit and active never taking any time off.
I go on the internet and find this forum. After looking at loads of others
I am not anti-meds but only use them as a last resort if all else seems to fail. (I am a forth degree Reiki Master Practitioner and a black belt so fairly fit most of life) 
I remember my mother used Milk of Magnesia so after reading the comments here went and got some and took 15ml at 17:00 (I did read the instructions but decided to take some) my thinking was  before I go to bed wrong! Nothing happened so at 23:00 I took another 10ml and went bed.
Day5: Wednesday 
I awoke feeling as I had done for the last 4 days still wanting a poo  desperately wanting a poo and pissed off that the MOM had not worked yet. I sat on the loo had pee and and nothing!
Went outside to inflate my wife&#039;s car tyre which has a very slow puncture so got the compressor out attached it to the valve and as I bent over I thought to myself I think I need to go to the loo. So slowly walked back indoors (no urgency at all) sat on the loo and my bum exploded in an instant with such force that it truly stunned me OMG!
No pain. No cramp. No nothing; almost no sensation at all, except the most amazing feeling of not being full of poo (which I have been accused of on more than one occasion) (wrongly I have to say being a Leo apart from the last 5 poo filled days)
Been twice again since this morning it&#039;s now 14:15 and having just finished this felt I had to say is fanbloodytastic.
Be warned it can happen very very quickly and almost violently when it does, in my case without any warning and I&#039;m happy to say without any pain or cramping at all (just lots and lots of noise and splashing and shouts from me (not of pain but of great relief. That must be the understatement of the year)

"""Well I am 34 and have had prostatitis a few times. I have tried Doxy, Cipro and E-Mycin. The first time I took Cipro it gave me bad anxiety and the feeling of elevated pulse so my doctor switched me to Doxy which had helped me in the past. The Doxy has the least amount of side effects if you are taking for 3-4 weeks. Cipro is the stronger drug and probably will work better for prostatitis but the side effects if you get them are pretty brutal. The last time I took it in a ditch effort it gave me leg cramps and foot pain, so that was a red flag because of the black box warning. So I guess its back to Doxy.

After many exhausting trips to urgent cares and emergency rooms, it was time to address my anxiety head on. After a trip to an urgent care in San Diego, a doctor prescribed me 10 0.25mg of Xanax.

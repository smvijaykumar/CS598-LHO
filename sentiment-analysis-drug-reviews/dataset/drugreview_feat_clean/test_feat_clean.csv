"""I switched to this primarily due to the appeal of having only 4 periods a year and stayed on it for 3 years. Generally it was uneventful: I didn&#039;t gain weight, it had no effect (positive or negative) on my acne, my breasts stayed the same size. However, it destroyed my libido. It was so gone I thought I was asexual. It wasn&#039;t until I couldn&#039;t get my script refilled  (I couldn&#039;t get an appointment that mixed in with my work schedule), so I had to get off the pill, which then led me to find out that I am not asexual and, in fact, had a libido.

"""My #1 prayer is that someone will read this BEFORE they put this poison in their body referred to as Mirena. I had the IUD put in after my Implanon was removed (btw, Implanon was incredible, for me. But my OB insisted I got Mirena). I had it in for about 5 years, yes my periods were light but sex sucked; it was painful during and after, I was never &quot;in the mood&quot;. I gained about 50 pounds, grew depressed obviously. Usually athletic and excited to work out, I became super tired and lazy all of the time. It took a toll on my relationship, I don&#039;t even see why he stayed with me (but he&#039;s amazing ☺️)! About a month ago I got the IUD removed. It was a short, sweet procedure and I instantly felt better (just knowing it was out of me gave me so much satisfaction). I was on a light period when it was removed and it eventually ended as normal.... one month later I started my period again (normal). But I have been bleeding since, it&#039;s been about 3.5-4 weeks. And if I&#039;m not &quot;bleeding&quot; I have brown discharge (looks like dried up blood). I feel crummy and I long for normalness! I felt as if I have taken 5 steps forward, getting it removed, just to take ten steps back! Don&#039;t do it! At this point I wouldn&#039;t advise bc at all but obviously people use it for other reasons besides getting pregnant. Nevertheless, the hormonal imbalance and emotional toll is not worth it! I pray after all of this I can even conceive another child. I don&#039;t know this for a fact: but I feel like there&#039;s got to be some kind of extra financial gain for OBs when they insert Mirena.
